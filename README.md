### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced Technical Program Manager with a lot of experience delivering software intiatives.  I've held various roles in the software industry including QA Engineer, Software developer, and Business Program Manager.  I love the technology of software delivery as well as the processes, communications and other functions that support delivery of functionality and delighting customers.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working to improve my C# and Typescript skills and learning more about **System Design**.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with lots of things but will let you know when I get stuck.
