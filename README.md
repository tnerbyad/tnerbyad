### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced Technical Program Manager with a lot of experience delivering software intiatives.  I've held various roles in the software industry including QA Engineer, Software Developer, and Business Program Manager.  I love not only the technology and coding part of software delivery, but also enjoy the other functions such as release planning, documentation, and support that are required for successful delivery of functionality and delighting customers.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working to improve my C# and Typescript skills and learning more about **System Design**.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with lots of things but will let you know when I get stuck.
